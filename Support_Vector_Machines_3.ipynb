        "  \n",
        "2. **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: This is the square root of the MSE, giving an interpretable metric in the same units as the target variable. It’s commonly used as it provides a sense of the average error magnitude.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values. It’s robust to outliers as it doesn’t square the errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **R-squared (R2)**: Represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable (house prices) that is predictable from the independent variables. It indicates how well the model fits the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "The choice of metric depends on your specific goals. If you want a metric that is sensitive to outliers, MSE or RMSE would be suitable. If you prefer a metric less influenced by outliers, MAE could be a good choice. R-squared helps understand the overall goodness of fit of the model.\n",

        "Here's why:\n",
        "\n",
        "MSE measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual prices. It penalizes larger errors more heavily due to the squaring operation. When your primary concern is the accuracy of predictions and you want to minimize the magnitude of errors, MSE can provide a comprehensive assessment of how well your model is performing in terms of prediction accuracy.\n",

        "Here's why MAE could be advantageous in such a scenario:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Robustness to Outliers**: MAE calculates the average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values. Unlike MSE (which squares the errors), MAE is less sensitive to extreme outliers since it doesn't emphasize or exaggerate the impact of these outliers in the error calculation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Outliers' Impact**: In the presence of outliers, MSE could be significantly influenced by the squared errors of these outliers, potentially skewing the evaluation of your model's performance. MAE, on the other hand, treats all errors equally in terms of magnitude, making it more robust in the presence of outliers.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Interpretability**: MAE gives a straightforward understanding of the average prediction error in the same units as the target variable, making it more interpretable, especially when dealing with house prices where the interpretation of error in the actual currency or price units is crucial.\n",

        "Here are some considerations:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**:\n",
        "   - RMSE gives more weight to larger errors due to its square root calculation. This makes it more sensitive to outliers or larger deviations between predicted and actual values.\n",
        "   - If the focus is on penalizing larger errors more severely or if you want to understand the average magnitude of the errors in the same units as the target variable, RMSE might be preferred.\n",

        "2. **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**:\n",
        "   - MSE doesn't involve the square root calculation and treats all errors equally, regardless of whether they are large or small.\n",
        "   - It might be preferred if you want a metric that measures the overall model performance without giving extra weight to larger errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "In general, if MSE and RMSE are very close, the choice between them could depend on the specific goals of your analysis. If you're okay with giving more weight to larger errors or if understanding the typical magnitude of errors is important, RMSE might be a better choice. Otherwise, MSE could be used as it simplifies the error calculation by treating all errors equally.\n",
        "\n",
        "There isn't necessarily a strict rule on which one to use if both are very close; it often comes down to the context of the problem and which aspect of the errors is more critical for decision-making.\n",
        "\n",
        "For practical purposes, if both MSE and RMSE are very close, choosing either one might not significantly impact the interpretation of the model's performance."
